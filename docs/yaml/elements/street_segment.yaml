_name: StreetSegment
description: |-
  A Street Segment objection represents a portion of a street and the links to the precinct that this
  geography (i.e., segment) is contained within. The start address house number must be less than the
  end address house number unless the segment consists of only one address, in which case these values
  are equal.
