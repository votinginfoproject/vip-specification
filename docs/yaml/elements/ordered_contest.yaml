  ``OrderedContest`` encapsulates links to the information that comprises a contest and potential
  ballot selections. ``OrderedContest`` elements can be collected within a
  :ref:`$$$-ballot-style` to accurate depict exactly what will show up on a particular
  ballot in the proper order.

    ignore it. If an ``OrderedBallotSelectionIds`` element is not present, the presumed
    order of the selection will be the order of :ref:`$$$-ballot-selection-base`-extended
    elements referenced by the underlying :ref:`$$$-contest-base`-extended elements.
