    give additional information about the offices. **Note:** the order of the office
    IDs **must** be in the same order as the candidates listed in `BallotSelectionIds`.
    E.g., if the various `BallotSelectionIds` reference :ref:`$$$-candidate-selection`
    elements which reference the candidate for President first and Vice-President
    second, the `OfficeIds` should reference the office of President first and the
    office of Vice-President second.
