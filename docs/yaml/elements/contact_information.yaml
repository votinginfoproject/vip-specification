  For defining contact information about objects such as persons, boards of authorities,
  organizations, etc. ContactInformation is always a sub-element of another object (e.g.
  :ref:`$$$-election-administration`, :ref:`$$$-office`,
  :ref:`$$$-person`, :ref:`$$$-source`). ContactInformation has an optional attribute
  ``label``, which allows the feed to refer back to the original label for the information
  (e.g. if the contact information came from a CSV, ``label`` may refer to a row ID).

  ``Name`` and ``AddressLine`` Usage Note
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The ``Name`` and ``AddressLine`` fields should be chosen so that a display
  or mailing address can be constructed programmatically by joining the
  ``Name`` and ``AddressLine`` fields together.  For example, for the
  following address::

      Department of Elections
      1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 48
      San Francisco, CA 94102

  The name could be "Department of Elections" and the first address line
  could be "1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 48."

  However, VIP does not yet support the representation of mailing addresses
  whose "name" portion spans more than one line, for example::

      California Secretary of State
      Elections Division
      1500 11th Street
      Sacramento, CA 95814

  For addresses like the above, we recommend choosing a name like, "California
  Secretary of State, Elections Division" with "1500 11th Street" as the
  first address line. This would result in a programmatically constructed
  address like the following::

      California Secretary of State, Elections Division
      1500 11th Street
      Sacramento, CA 95814
