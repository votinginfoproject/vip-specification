  The Election object represents an Election Day, which usually consists of many individual contests
  and/or referenda. A feed must contain **exactly one** Election object. All relationships in the
  feed (e.g., street segment to precinct to polling location) are assumed to relate only to
  the Election specified by this object. It is permissible, and recommended, to combine unrelated
  contests (e.g., a special election and a general election) that occur on the same day into one feed
  with one Election object.
