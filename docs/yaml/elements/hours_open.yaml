description: |-
  A structured way of describing the days and hours that a place such as a
  :ref:`$$$-office` or :ref:`$$$-polling-location` is open, or
  that an event such as an :ref:`$$$-election` is happening. The range of days
  indicated by the `StartDate` and `EndDate` in each `Schedule`_ element
  should not overlap with peer `Schedule`_ elements. For example, it is
  invalid to specify a schedule from 10/01/2016 to 10/31/2016 and also
  specify a schedule from 10/10/2016 to 10/11/2016 within the same `HoursOpen`
  element.

  error: At least one valid `Schedule`_ must be present for ``HoursOpen`` to be valid.
    If no valid `Schedule`_ is present, the implementation is required to ignore the
    ``HoursOpen`` element.
