description: |-
  A place ID that refers to a specific entity by a given data provider.  The data provider and ID are free-form to support arbitrary
  providers, but the following providers/formats should be respected as defined, or else ignored.  This element is not supported in CSV format.

  .. _`dataProvider`: The data provider for this ID.  Required.

  .. _`sortOrder`: The numeric sorting order of this place ID relative to other place IDs when selecting which supported place ID to use.
    Fractional sort orders like 1.5 are permitted.
    If unspecified, the default sort order is 1.
    Lower sort orders should be preferred over higher sort orders, and any accompanying address should be assumed to have sort order 0.
    Use a negative sort order to prioritize a place ID over the address.
