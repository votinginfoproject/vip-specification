  description: If specified, the contexts in which this emergency notice applies.
    Users should ignore emergency notices that do not contain an `AppliesTo` that they support.
    If no `AppliesTo` is specified, this is assumed to be a general notification and users may
    determine whether to show it in their context.  Public APIs such as the Civic Info API should
    always transmit election notices that have no `AppliesTo` specified.
