DistrictType
============

Enumeration describing the set of possible jurisdiction and district types.
Please use the enumeration value which most accurately reflects the type of
district or jurisdiction in your state or county. For example, "town" and
"township" may mean different things -- or not be defined at all -- in your
state, so please use the definition which best matches your local meaning.
