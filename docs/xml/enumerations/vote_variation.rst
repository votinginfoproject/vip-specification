VoteVariation
=============

Note that the descriptions below describe what the enumeration names
stand for in the context of the VIP spec, rather than provide general
definitions of the election terms that the names correspond to.  For example,
even though there are majority voting methods that are not "1-of-m" (e.g.
ranked choice voting), we constrain "majority" to 1-of-m.  We do this to
eliminate any source of ambiguity when a single enumeration value needs
to be assigned to a contest.
