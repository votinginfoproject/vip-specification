party.txt  
==============

This element describes a political party and the metadata associated with them. These can also include “dummy” parties to indicate a type of contest (e.g., a Voter Nominated CandidateContest can use the PrimaryPartyIds field and a dummy Party object to indicate that the contest is a “Top-Two” primary).
