  description: The common street address (as well as city, state, and zip) of the
    start and end points of the segment. Specific information such as street direction
    should be included.
  error: If the element is not present or invalid, the implementation is required
    to ignore the StreetSegment element containing it
  required: true
  type: NonHouseAddress
- _name: IncludesAllAddresses
  description: Specifies if the segment covers every address on this street. If this
    is *true*, then the values of **StartHouseNumber** and **EndHouseNumber** should
    be ignored. The value of **OddEvenBoth** must be *both*.
  error: If the field is not present or invalid, the implementation is required to
    ignore it.
  type: xs:boolean
- _name: OddEvenBoth
  description: Specifies whether the odd side of the street (in terms of house numbers),
    the even side, or both are in included in the street segment.
  error: If the field is not present or invalid, the implementation is required to
    ignore the StreetSegment containing it.
  required: true
  type: OebEnum
- _name: PrecinctId
  description: References the :doc:`precinct <precinct>` that contains the entire
    street segment.
  error: If the field is not present or invalid, the implementation is required to
    ignore the StreetSegment element containing it.
  type: xs:IDREF
- _name: StartHouseNumber
  description: The house number at which the street segment starts. This value is
    necessary for the street segment to make any sense. Unless **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value must be less than or equal to **EndHouseNumber**. If **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value is ignored.
  error: Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true, if the field is not present or invalid,
    the implementation is required to ignore the street segment element containing
    it. If the **StartHouseNumber** is greater than the **EndHouseNumber**, the implementation
    should ignore the element containing them.
  type: xs:integer
- _name: EndHouseNumber
  description: The house number at which the street segment ends. This value is necessary
    for the street segment to make any sense. Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true,
    it must be greater than or equal to **StartHouseNumber**. If **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value is ignored.
  error: Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true, if the field is not present or invalid,
    the implementation is required to ignore the street segment element containing
    it. If the **EndHouseNumber** is less than the **StartHouseNumber**, the implementation
    should ignore the element containing it.
  type: xs:integer
- _name: UnitNumber
  description: The apartment/unit number for a street segment. If this value is present
    then **StartHouseNumber** must be equal to **EndHouseNumber**. This field cannot
